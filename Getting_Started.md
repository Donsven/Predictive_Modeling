# Welcome to the Team!

Glad to have you onboard for our predictive modeling project! During these early weeks while you're getting familiar, here are a few things I'd like you all to brush up on:

## 1. Linear Regression

For this project, I plan on starting with **Linear Regression** as it is a fundamental part of machine learning and also a lot easier to grasp and understand. 

**Resource:** [Codecademy - Simple Linear Regression Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/simple-linear-regression-course) (free!)

## 2. Git/GitHub

I can't stress this one enough. Understanding how to use Git is absolutely fundamental — so much that I actually want to take the time during our next standup to show you all the workflow we're looking for. 

**IF YOU'RE UNFAMILIAR WITH GIT:**
Please check out this resource, it's a great interactive tool that will teach you what "git" is and how crucial it is in our project - [Learn git branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=en_US)


**General workflow:**
```
create feature branch → make edits → pull from main → open pull request → merge → repeat
```

*Don't forget to pull from main regularly to keep up to date*

**Important: Commit Message Standards**

Please follow this format for all commit messages:
```
[COMMIT TYPE]: [COMMIT MESSAGE]
```

**Commit types:**
- `feat` - New features
- `fix` - Bug fixes
- `doc` - Documentation changes
- `refactor` - Code refactoring
- `test` - Test additions or modifications

**Example:** `feat: add data preprocessing pipeline`

## 3. Python

Pretty obvious and not too hard. There's lots of great resources out there, but this one is a personal favorite of mine:

**Resource:** [futurecoder.io](https://futurecoder.io)

## 4. What's Next?

There will be other things as we go along, such as **CI/CD workflows**. We can touch on those later.
